# Damn Vulnerable CPU project

This repository contains basic x32 CPU simulator and CPU fuzzer 
This CPU simulator has various vulnerability by design and few software bugs too along with some security control. so as an attacker you need to bypass those security controls and triger those vulnerablity
I built this project to educate people on various bugs in CPUs

People can also use CPU fuzzer to find bugs automatically in CPU simulator
