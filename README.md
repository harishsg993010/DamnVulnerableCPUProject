# Damn Vulnerable CPU project

This project is a simple CPU emulator and fuzzer designed to demonstrate basic CPU functionality and explore potential vulnerabilities. The emulator implements a custom instruction set, memory management with paging, and various CPU features. The fuzzer generates random programs to test the CPU emulator and identify vulnerabilities.

## Features

Custom instruction set with various arithmetic, memory, and control flow instructions
Paging system with page permissions and page fault handling
Branch prediction and speculative execution
Cache and memory protection
Stack management with call and return instructions
Interrupt handling and privileged mode execution
I/O port support
